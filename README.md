## Overview

**MacroMates** is an innovative health and nutrition platform designed to help users set, track, and achieve their dietary goals with ease. By leveraging AI and a modern tech stack, MacroMates streamlines the process of meal logging and macro tracking, making healthy eating accessible and sustainable for everyone.

**Key Features:**

- **AI-Powered Meal Analysis:** Snap a photo of your meal and instantly receive detailed macronutrient and calorie breakdowns.
- **Personalized Insights:** Meal scores and recommendations are tailored to each user's biometric data and nutrition goals.
- **Natural Language Goal Setting:** Set goals like “I want to lose 5kg in 2 months” and receive smart, realistic suggestions.
- **Visual Progress Tracking:** Interactive charts, graphs, and dashboards to monitor daily, weekly, and monthly macro intake.
- **Historical Data:** Analyze trends and patterns in your eating habits over time.

## Problem Statement

Traditional nutrition tracking apps require tedious manual entry, leading to abandoned goals and poor long-term results. MacroMates solves this by automating meal logging and providing instant, personalized feedback, making nutrition tracking both effective and enjoyable.

## How MacroMates Works

1. **Set Your Goals:** Define clear objectives in natural language (e.g., “I want to lose 5 kg in 2 months”). AI refines and validates these goals with personalized suggestions and realistic timelines.
2. **Log Meals Instantly:** Snap a photo of your meal; AI instantly analyzes the contents, calculating calories and macronutrients.
3. **Get Personalized Feedback:** Receive insights and meal scores tailored to your biometrics, age, and goals.
   - Example: The same plate of fries may score lower for an older user reducing cholesterol but higher for a younger athlete aiming to bulk.
4. **Track Progress:** Visualize your macro intake and goal achievement with intuitive dashboards.
